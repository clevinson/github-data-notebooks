## Github Data Notebooks

For better data analytics of the activity surrounding the Cosmos SDK, we use python notebooks to perform ad-hoc analytics and use that data for monthly internal reporting & tracking of activity on github.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have python and jupyter installed. These notebooks are intended for use with python3, jupyter core >= 4.6, and jupyter-notebook >= 6.0


Install the relevant python libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure any environment variables are setup correctly in a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for format).


### Usage

Run the notebook server to access and edit the notebooks:

```
jupyter notebook
```
